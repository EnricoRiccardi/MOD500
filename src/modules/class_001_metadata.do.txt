===== Data properties =====
* All starts from data: what are data-properties?

!bpop
* Are there such things as good data and bad data?

!bblock Main lesson (Exam question)
* Data color{red}{ DO NOT always} have value.

===== MetaData properties =====
Data without metadata are just numbers
(i.e. if they are integers, they are still good to play lottery)

Metadata can be pretty much anything. Depending on the application, we can distinguish between:
!bpop
o Descriptive : used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
o Structural : describe how compound objects are put together. It describes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.
o Administrative : to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.
o Reference : to indicate the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
o Statistical : (or process data), may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.
o Legal : creator, copyright, licensing.

===== MetaData for sharing and re-use =====

More considerations:

!bpop
* Metadata is more and more important in a digital open world.

* Researchers and automatic algorithms would benefit from importing data directly.

* FAIR research is an important part of Open Science revolution (Findable, Accessible, interoperable, Reusable)

* New applications, business, discoveries can be thus enabled.

* ChatGPT, Bard, Gemini, and all the LLMs are functional only thanks to this!

* Who would be responsible for them then?
* What is the advantage for who releases the data?
* Who gets the money for what?
* Copyright for data and/or for data processing?
