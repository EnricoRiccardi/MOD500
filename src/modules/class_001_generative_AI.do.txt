======= Generative AI =======
!bblock
A generative AI model is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to generate new content, based on the data it has been trained on.
!eblock

It started in 1932, with the _mechanical brain_ by Georges Artsrouni that was suppoused to translate automatically between languages,

===== Generative AI =====
Key characteristics of generative AI models include:

!bpop
o   Learning from Data: They are trained on large datasets, enabling them to learn patterns, styles, or features inherent in the data.

o   Generating New Content: Generative models can create new data instances. For example, a model trained on a dataset of paintings can generate new images in the style of those paintings.

Trained generative models are thus able to input information at a low resolution/dimension and give output with a much greater dimensionality.

===== Applications =====

Here a list of possible applications:

!bpop
* Images/video: Image generation, Super-resolution, Deep fakes.

* Music: noise filter, voice and music generation, voice deep fake.

* Text(LLM): chatGPT, bard, Gemini, etc.

* Chemistry:  DeepMind (Alphafold).

* Coding (co-pilot)

* Speech

* Attacks and Hacking (Security testing)

* Generating training sets

* And many more

===== Science fiction? =====
This is scary:

!bpop
o Virtual best friends
o Medical images to show diseases consequences
o Synthetic data for digital twins
o Preemptive suggestions (e.g. driving)
o Matrix

!split
===== Problems (currently) =====
New possibilities do not come with side effects.

!bpop
o Lack of transparency: how the output is generated, and why?
o Accuracy: a lot of hallucinations
o Bias: human biases are kept, supported and eventually increased
o Intellectual properties (IP): who owns what is produced?
o Cybersecutiry and frauds: mass cyber attacks can be created
o Sustainability: massive quantity of electricity is used
o Responsibility (who to blame?): Will AI get citizenship everywhere?

===== A new field? =====
Generative AI is actually a new evolution.

It is based on Neural Network, and in comprises a set of advanced tools (numerical recepites):

\pause

o Generative Adversarial Networks
o Generative Pre-trained Transformers
o Variational Autoencoders
o Conditional Variational Autoencoders
o Autoencoders

!split
===== Types of generative AI =====
It is quite an advanced technique
