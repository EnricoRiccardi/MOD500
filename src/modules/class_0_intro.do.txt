* Understand the key factors involved in making good decisions.
* Evaluate the challenges we face when making decisions.

!split
===== Metalearning =====
FIGURE: [${FGC}/piramid]

!split
===== Metalearning =====
* Pedagogic empiricism teaches us that good learning happens in social contexts where the students are actively participating in the classroom dialogue
\pause
* In general, the number of questions, and the dialogue in general, drops significantly when lectures are recorded
\pause
* Streaming tends to lead to empty classrooms and higher failure rate.



!split
===== Teaching method =====
_!Active Learning!_

!bpop
* There will be a combination of lectures and tutorials.

* Tutorial and hands-on will be presented during the course.

* Study groups are strongly encouraged.

* In class discussions are encouraged at any stage.

* Flip classroom approach: problem first (when possible).

* Feedback expected from you!

* Note: each teacher, even if coordinated, will have a different approach/expectations.
!epop


!split
===== Python =====
The tutorials and hands-on will be mostly based on python.

!bpop
* An introduction to python will be provided during the course. Yet, this is not a Python programming course!

* You are _strogly advised_ to construct your own Git repository (and to keep it in order).

* Group projects will have different roles.

===== A personal considerations on generative AI =====
!bblock
With great power comes great responsibility (Spider-Man)
!eblock

LLMs can and shall be used. As their development is surging in the last years, their help
in writing code and reports is undeniable. Students shall learn how to master these tools.
Yet, while their usage is encouraged, the risk of excessively rely on them _DO_ hinder learning.

\pause

If you want to be a student (i.e. whom is learning), you are encouraged to take the responsibility in delivering original
output.

* In this course we will learn to use data and models (ML) to make better decisions.
* Each application will be a mere exercise of the concepts we will introduce here.

===== Uncertainty =====
It is present in every stage of life (at each decision).

You would thus need to:
!bpop
o Rationalize uncertainty (qualify)
o Quantify uncertainty
o Make decisions under uncertainty
o Operate under uncertainty

!epop

!split
===== Uncertainty or Probability? =====

Our aim here is to provide good guidance on how to link data, models and output to value creation.

!bpop
* First we need to understand uncertainty and probability, and the difference between the two.

!bblock
* Spoiler: Probability is the language of uncertainty!
!eblock

\vspace{1em}

* We will analyse, quantify and structure models as a function of uncertainty.

* Clarity of language in probability is one of the hallmarks of decision analysis
!epop



!split
===== Data properties =====

* All starts from data: what are data-properties?

!bpop
* Are there such things as good data and bad data?

!bblock Life lesson (or exam question, same thing ;) )
* Data color{red}{ DO NOT always} have value.

===== Hard and soft modeling =====

Models allow us to predict ’the future’, or describe the past and
present (what is the present...?)

!bblock Last life lesson for today
Models are always wrong, but some are useful. (George Box)
!eblock
!epop

!bpop
=== Three main families: ===
o Hard models (physics)
o Soft models (statistic)
o Machine learning (Nice! But what is it?)
!epop

!split
===== Hard modeling =====
!bpop

* Based on an accurate physical description of the system and mathematical modeling (e.g. differential equations). Hard models are often deterministic.

* Hard modeling methods usually use optimization methods to find out the best values for the parameters of the model.

* Hard modeling is preferable in laboratory experiments, where all the variables are controlled and the physicochemical nature of the dynamic model is known and can be fully described using a known mathematical model.

* Hard modeling, if successful, usually gives better understanding of a system and better extrapolations. Wrong assumptions often lead to non-sense results.
!epop

!split
===== Soft modeling =====

!bpop
* Soft-modeling describes systems without the need of an *a priori* physical or (bio)chemical model postulation. They are _data driven_ models.

* Soft models are much easier to make than hard models.

* Soft modeling can be used to understand complex relationships.

* Soft modeling needs (much) more data than hard-modeling.

* Soft models have a poor extrapolating capabilities (compared with hard-modeling)
!epop


!split
===== How to create hard models? =====
After understanding the problem to be solved we need to:

o Link mathematics to physics.
o Define boundary conditions and constitutive equations.
o Make tons of assumptions.
o Solve the constitutive equation in space and time.
o Check solution stability and sensitivity analysis.
o A long set of judicious approximations have to be taken.
o It is hard (but we are engineers!).
o Get quite some money for the awesome job.


!split
===== How to create soft models? =====

After understanding the general problem to be solved we need to:

* Determine a suitable _numerical description_ .
* Choose a suitable _model_ to which parameters are fitted.
* Train, test, validate the model.
* Perform _data analysis_ with chosen method(s).
* Link predictions with expectations.
